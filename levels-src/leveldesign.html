<a name="s1"><h2>1. Converting levels to VL format</h2>
<p>After creating your level file in Inkscape, you need to convert it to a .vl
file that can be read by Shotgun Debugger. The conversion script,
<tt>svg2vl</tt>, is written in Perl. If you're on a *nix system, you've probably
already got Perl. Refer to the <tt>svg2vl</tt> setup guide for more information.</p>

<p>To convert your SVG, from the command line, type
<blockquote><tt>$ svg2vl level_file</tt></blockquote>
(where <tt>$</tt> is the command prompt) The <tt>.svg</tt> extension is optional.
If everything converted well, it should finish with <tt>End of line</tt>, and
you should have <tt>level_file.vl</tt> in the same directory as the SVG.</p>

<p>You can then play your level by specifying it on the command line:
<blockquote><tt>$ sdb level_file</tt></blockquote>
(Again, the <tt>.vl</tt> extension is optional.) You can also add the line
<tt>level level_file</tt> to the <tt>preferences.txt</tt>. Selecting "new game"
at the menu will bring you to your level, and it will <i>not</i> overwrite your save.</p>

<p>If you do not specify an argument, Shotgun Debugger plays the most recently loaded
level; if you wish to return to normal play, remove the <tt>level level_file</tt> line
in <tt>preferences.txt</tt>.

<a name="s2"><h2>2. Layer structure</h2>
A level file must define many things; not only the shape of the rooms,
but the location of doors, enemies, and powerups, and the interactions
between them as well. Inkscape's layering ability (similar to
Photoshop's) allows one to work with different kinds of objects
independently.</p>

<p>The layers used in a VL file are typically all of the following (in
order, bottom to top):
<ul>
<li><tt>floor</tt>, for defining surfaces that can be walked on
<li><tt>arch</tt>, for defining <i>arch</i>itecture, usually in the
forms of polygons ("wall-polygons") that represent walls, columns,
etc.
<li><tt>surfaces</tt>, for defining surfaces that have an additional
effect on objects (healing, less friction, damage, etc.)
<li><tt>objects</tt>, for defining entities (the player, enemies,
powerups) in the level.
<li><tt>paths</tt>, for defining the network of path nodes that enemies will use to navigate through the level.
<li><tt>lights</tt>, for creating special lighting effects.
<li><tt>masks</tt>, for defining "ceiling" polygons with obscure
unvisited sections of the map when viewed from above.
</ul>
It is highly recommended that you place your layers in this order
(floor on bottom, masks on top). When creating a new layer in
Inkscape, it is important to realize that you cannot just set the name
of the layer, you must change its <tt>id</tt> attribute in the XML
editor.</p>
<p>If you want, you can have multiple layers of a given type. Layer
names are prefix-based; i.e. if you wanted to have 3 <tt>arch</tt> layers,
you could create new layers called <tt>arch2</tt> and
<tt>arch3</tt> (Any suffix will work). Multiple layers will be interpreted in the order they
were placed in Inkscape, bottom to top.</p>

<a name="s3"><h2>3. The <tt>&lt;vl&gt;</tt> element</h2>
<p>If you're starting from scratch with a blank Inkscape document, not
only do you have to create the layer hierarchy, but a special
<tt>&lt;vl&gt;</tt> element as well. This is essential, as it tells
<tt>svg2vl</tt> that this is a VL level file, not just an SVG
file. Make sure it has the following attributes:</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>name</tt></dt>
<dd>The level's name.</dd>
<dt><tt>author</tt></dt>
<dd>Your name.</dd>
<dt><tt>bg</tt></dt>
<dd>A hex color (<tt>#rrggbb</tt>) representing the level's background
color. Default is black (<tt>#000000</tt>).</dd>
</dl>

<p>And, if you want to experiment with lighting, you can use the following:</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>lightcolor</tt></dt>
<dd>A hex color (<tt>#rrggbb</tt>) specifying the color of the level's ambient
light. Default is white (<tt>#FFFFFF</tt>).</dd>
<dt><tt>lightintensity</tt></dt>
<dd>A number from 0.0 to 1.0  specifying the intensity of the level's ambient
light. Default is 0.2.</dd>
<dt><tt>lightdirection</tt></dt>
<dd>The "angle" that the ambient light points at. While not a very
good metaphor, it affects the calculation of the shading. Should be
fine at its default of 90 (degrees).</dd>
<dt><tt>augmented</tt></dt>
<dd>Whether this level is meant to be played in the "special" manner,
as Level 8 is.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="s4"><h2>4. Other notes</h2>
<p>Remember that curved segments of all kind are strictly
forbidden. <tt>svg2vl</tt> will scream bloody murder at you if you
accidentally leave one in. It will also tell you the <tt>id</tt> of
the offending shape, so you can easily correct it. (Inkscape even
allows you to locate objects by ID: just press Ctrl-F to bring up
the Find dialog!)</p>
<p>The element hierarchy also allows for inheritance. Instead of
assigning a property to several objects, you can group them and use
the XML editor to assign those properties to the group element. All
properties (including color/opacity) will be properly inherited when
converted. It works with layers too; you can assign a property to a
layer element, and it will be reflected in all objects in that
layer. I'd recommend against grouping layer elements...I don't know
what Inkscape would do, and I'm sure <tt>svg2vl</tt> wouldn't like
it.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you know how to use the XML editor and understand
what terms like "elements" and "attributes" refer to. Not too hard to comprehend...</p>
<p>To <tt>svg2vl</tt>, everyting is case sensitive. All attributes and
values should be lowercase, exactly as I type them. And when I talk
about something's "default" value, this is the value that will be used
if the attribute is omitted entirely.</p>


<a name="s5"><h2>5. Floors (<tt>floor</tt> layer)</h2>
<p>The <tt>floor</tt> layer is the bottom-most plane, and should be one
of the first things laid out. Any polygon with a fill color will be
interpreted as a floor; it is recommended that you set stroke width to
zero for these polygons.</p>
<p>Note that if any object moves onto an area not covered by a floor
polygon, it will fall to its <b>DEATH</b>. Make sure that there are no
open seams between floor segments; the grid is a Good Thing, and a
little overlap between polygons is not a problem.</p>
<h4>Additional XML attributes</h4>
<dl>
<dt><tt>friction</tt></dt>
<dd>Specifies the friction coefficient of this floor polygon. The default is
0.5. Maximum friction is 1.0 (this is generally a <i>bad</i> idea) and
minimum is 0.0. Lower friction coefficients may result in drastic results when running at very low frame rates.</dd>
<dt><tt>lit</tt></dt>
<dd>Whether this floor is affected by lighting effects. Value is
either <tt>y</tt> or <tt>n</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt>cd</tt></dt>
<dd>Whether to check this floor during collision detection (<tt>y</tt>
or <tt>n</tt>, default <tt>y</tt>). This should always be y (we don't
want stuff randomly falling through the floor) unless you're putting
the floor far away and are certain no object will step on it.</dd>
<dt><tt>trigger, trigtype</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s13">Triggers</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>

<a name="s6"><h2>6. Wall and "ceiling" polygons (<tt>arch</tt> layer)</h2>
<p>These suckers pretty much define your level. Note the importance of
polygon stroke and fill; the stroke of a polygon is transformed into a
set of walls extruded vertically; if the polygon has a fill, it is
drawn as a "cap" or "ceiling" on top of those extruded walls. Thus, if
your polygon has no stroke, no walls will be created, and vice
versa. The thickness of the stroke is irrelevant; make it something
reasonable and unobtrusive for you.</p>
<p>When creating walls, always create closed polygons. Don't make
unconnected line segments and use them as very thin walls. This is
because walls are one-way; they must have a "front" and a "back." If
you were to create a wall with a single segment, you would collide
with one side, but get sucked right through on the other. While this
might be exploited to produce weird effects, for the most part, stick
to closed polygons.</p>

<h4>Additional XML attributes</h4>
<dl>
<dt><tt>h</tt></dt>
<dd>The height of a wall-polygon. Default is 6.5 feet. Walls that sink
into the floor can also be created with negative values; it is
important to remember that since Shotgun Debugger is a 2D game, you
will still collide with "phantom" walls if you have
negatively-extruded wall-polygons.</dd>
<dt><tt>lit</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s5">Floors</a>.</i></dd>
<dt><tt>force</tt></dt>
<dd>The amount of force an object is repelled with if it comes in
contact with the wall. This is still buggy and inconsistent. Default
is 0 and it should stay that way for now.</dd>
<dt><tt>health</tt></dt>
<dd>The amount of health an object will gain if it touches the wall. A
negative number will cause the player to lose health. Default is 0.</dd>
<dt><tt>particles</tt></dt>
<dd>The type of particles that are emitted when a bullet or object
touches this wall. Takes an object identifier; see <a href="#s9">Objects</a> for more
information.</dd>
<dt><tt>particleqty</tt></dt>
<dd>The number of particles emitted when a bullet or object
touches this wall. Default is 0.</dd>
<dt><tt>cd</tt></dt>
<dd>Whether this wall-polygon should be checked for collisions. Value
is a y/n pair; <tt>yy</tt>, <tt>nn</tt>, <tt>yn</tt>, etc. The first
y/n specifies whether to check collisions with objects; the second
specifies whether to check collisions with bullets. For example, a
wall whose <tt>cd</tt> attribute is <tt>yn</tt> could be shot through
but not walked through.</dd>
<dt><tt>ricochet</tt></dt>
<dd>Whether bullets ricochet off this wall (y/n). Default is n.</dd>
<dt><tt>trigger, trigtype</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s13">Triggers</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you want to create some small, very elaborate structures with
walls, consider turning off collision detection (<tt>cd=nn</tt>) for
the walls that make up this structure, then creating an invisible
bounding box (walls with 100%-transparent stroke) around it. This
will greatly reduce the number of collision checks the game performs.</p>

<a name="s7"><h2>7. Doors (<tt>arch</tt> layer)</h2>
<p>Doors are created with single line segments. To make a door, draw a
line segment from one wall to another (or even in the middle of
nowhere). The thickness of this line <i>does</i> matter; it represents
the thickness of the door you see in the game (WYSIWYG). Doors take
all the XML attributes of walls, and several others.</p>
<p>I always like to make the doors extend into the walls slightly to
reduce the appearance of seams, and set the height to just a couple
inches below the height of the walls.</p>
<p>Doors are opened when one enters their enclosing circle (centered
at the midpoint of the line segment). To make double doors that open
when the player walks up to them in the center, create two full-width
doors that overlap and open in opposite directions.</p>

<h4>Additional XML attributes</h4>
<dl>
<dt><tt>opens</tt></dt>
<dd>The direction the door opens in. This value can be either
<tt>slide1</tt>, where the door slides open toward the first point
drawn, or <tt>slide2</tt>, to open in the opposite direction. More
types of doors might come in the future.</dd>
<dt><tt>speed</tt></dt>
<dd>The speed at which a door opens; the inverse of the time it takes the
door to open. A value of 5 would cause the door to open in 1/5
second. Default is 2 (1/2 second).</dd>
<dt><tt>delay</tt></dt>
<dd>The amount of time this door stays open before closing, in
seconds. Default is 1.</dd>
<dt><tt>key</tt></dt>
<dd>A value greater than 0 means the door is locked and must be opened
with the numbered key. As of now there are plans for a five-key
maximum; keep the value between 0 and 5.</dd>
<dt><tt>unlockwhen, openwhen, jamwhen</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s14">Trigger responses</a>.</i></dd>
<dt><tt>trigger, trigtype</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s13">Triggers</a>.</i></dd>
<dt><tt>flags</tt></dt>
<dd>A y/n pair. The first y/n indicates if this door is to play sounds
when it is opened, closed, and unlocked. The second y/n indicates if
a "This door is locked," etc. status message is to be displayed when
the player walks near the door. Default is <tt>yy</tt>.
</dl>

<a name="s8"><h2>8. Surfaces (<tt>surfaces</tt> layer)</h2>
<p>Surface are, well, special surfaces, like health jelly, lava,
slime, mud, etc. that affect objects in some way. You should draw them
with no stroke.</p>
<p>An object cannot stand on a surface; if you draw a surface over an
area wher there is no floor, the object will fall through it.</p>

<h4>Additional XML attributes</h4>
<dl>
<dt><tt>friction, lit, cd</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s5">Floors</a>.</i></dd>
<dt><tt>health</tt></dt>
<dd>The amount of health an object gains per second when standing on
this surface. A negative number will hurt the object. Default is
0.</dd>
<dt><tt>particles, particleqty</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s6">Walls</a>.</i></dd>
<dt><tt>trigger, trigtype</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s13">Triggers</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>

<a name="s9"><h2>9. Objects (<tt>objects</tt> layer)</h2>
Objects are things in the level--the player, enemies, powerups,
etc. Unfortunately, representing an object in Inkscape is not an easy
thing, so we have to be a little abstract here. An object is
represented as a rectangle (use the Rectangle tool) in the
<tt>objects</tt> layer. It will be centered at the rectangle's
center. Since the visual representation doesn't really do much for us,
most object properties are defined as XML attributes.</p>
<h4>Additional XML attributes</h4>
<dl>
<dt><tt>objecttype</tt></dt>
<dd>Specifies this object's type. The value is a string found in the
<tt>object_table.txt</tt> file, a file which contains a list of all
recognized objects. Only a few have been implemented in 0.61; the rest
will be added as they are modeled, etc. See <a href="#s10">Object types</a> for a list of
the currently implemented objects.</dd>
<dt><tt>heading</tt></dt>
<dd>The direction the object is facing, in degrees. 0 degrees is
pointing east, 90 is north, etc. Default is 0.</dd>
<dt><tt>fixed</tt></dt>
<dd>If this is set to <tt>y</tt>, the object will not be able to be pushed or moved by explosions. Default is <tt>n</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt>trigger, trigtype</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s13">Triggers</a>.</i></dd>
<dt><tt>wakewhen, killwhen</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s14">Trigger Responses</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<h4>The player object</h4>
The player is a special object, with an <tt>objecttype</tt> of
<tt>player</tt>. This object's <tt>id</tt> attribute must also be set
to <tt>player</tt>. If you do not add a player object. <tt>svg2vl</tt>
will get very angry.</p>

<a name="s10"><h2>10. Object types</h2>
This is a list of all the objects you can add to your levels: (eemember, case matters! All lowercase!):
<ul>
<li><tt>player:</tt> The player.
<li><tt>o_crate:</tt> Wooden crate.
<li><tt>o_barrel:</tt> Exploding barrel.
<li><tt>o_steel_crate:</tt> Metal box; heavy and unbreakable.

<li><tt>e_unarmed_guard:</tt> Kamikaze robot, as seen in the early levels.
<li><tt>e_mib:</tt> Man in black, as seen on the first level.
<li><tt>e_armed_drone:</tt> Purple shooting robot.
<li><tt>e_hunter:</tt> Bipedal attack robot.
<li><tt>e_gladiator:</tt> Gladiator robot.
<li><tt>e_turret1:</tt> Rotating gun turret.
<li><tt>e_slave_turret:</tt> A turret whose rotation is fixed;
it fires as long as a trigger is activated. (see <a href="#s14">Trigger responses</a>)

<li><tt>p_health:</tt> Health pack (recharges 25 health units)
<li><tt>p_energy_clip:</tt> Ammo clip for the energy rifle. (40 shots)
<li><tt>p_shotgun_ammo:</tt> Ammo for the shotgun. (6 shots)
<li><tt>p_hepa_clip:</tt> Ammo clip for the HEPA. (4 shots)
<li><tt>p_laser_cell:</tt> Ammo for the laser. (6 shots)
<li><tt>p_grenade:</tt> One grenade.
<li><tt>p_esg_battery:</tt> One battery for the ESG.
<li><tt>p_key1, p_key2, p_key3:</tt> Keys. (red, green, indigo)

<li><tt>p_rifle:</tt> Energy rifle.
<li><tt>p_shotgun:</tt> "A freakin' 12-gauge, what do you
<i>think!</i>?"
<li><tt>p_hepa:</tt> Highly Experimental Positron Accelerator. 'Nuff said.
<li><tt>p_red_laser:</tt> Laser.
<li><tt>p_esg:</tt> The EMP Shock Generator.

<li><tt>exploder:</tt> An invisible exploding barrel, meant to be set
off by a trigger.
</ul>

The following particle types have also been implemented. These values
can be used for the <tt>particles</tt> attribute:
<tt>part:spark, part:rainbow, part:blood, part:slime,
part:electricity,</tt> and <tt>part:energy</tt>.

<a name="s11"><h2>11. Lights (<tt>lights</tt> layer)</h2>
Shotgun Debugger utilizes pre-computer, per-vertex lighting. You can
specify areas of light by drawing circles in the <tt>lights</tt>
layer. The color of the circle, naturally, determines the color of the
light. The opacity of the circle determines the light's power, and the
circle's radius determines its radius of illumination.</p>

<h4>Additional XML attributes</h4>
<dl>
<dt><tt>lightspot</tt></dt>
<dd>Determines whether or not to draw the glowing "light spot"
underneath a light. Default is <tt>y</tt>.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="s12"><h2>12. Masks (<tt>masks</tt> layer)</h2>
Masks are polygonal "shrouds" one can place over areas of their map to
shield their contents from being seen until the player actually enters
that area. This is similar to the "fog of war" effect in real-time
strategy games.

<h4>Additional XML attributes</h4>
<dl>
<dt><tt>h</tt></dt>
<dd>The height of the mask. It should be the same height as the
surrounding walls; but high enough so that polygons in the middle of
the area don't clip through it. If you're going to use a mask in an
area, it's good to ensure that all objects are slightly shorter than
the mask height to prevent this.</dd>
<dt><tt>fadespeed</tt></dt>
<dd>How quickly the mask fades once the player enters its area. It is
the inverse of the time it takes to fade (cf. <tt>speed</tt> for
doors). Default is 3 (1/3 second).</dd>
<dt><tt>reobscure</tt></dt>
<dd>Whether this mask should cover itself back up when the player leaves
its boundaries. Default is <tt>n</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt>openwhen</tt></dt>
<dd><i>See <a href="#s14">Trigger Responses</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>

<a name="s13"><h2>13. Triggers</h2>
<p>Shotgun Debugger incorporates a simple yet flexible trigger system to
allow for puzzles and "scripted" events. Triggers are referred to by
their number; 0 represents no trigger, while 1-63 are triggers
available to the level designer.</p>

<p>You can tell an object to set off a trigger by setting its
<tt>trigger</tt> attribute; this is the number of the trigger this
object will activate. Walls activate a trigger when touched; doors
activate a trigger when opened; surfaces and floors activate triggers
when an object moves onto them; objects activate triggers when they
are killed.</p>

<p>In addition, you can specify further trigger behavior with the
<tt>trigtype</tt> attribute. It can be set to one of the following:
<dl>
<dt><tt>once</tt></dt>
<dd>The trigger is set off once, and never again.</dd>
<dt><tt>every</tt></dt>
<dd>When an object is on a surface or a floor, the trigger is set off
continuously every frame as long as an object is on it. This mode
works well with slave turrets.</dd>
<dt><tt>normal</tt></dt>
<dd>The trigger is set off every time an object moves onto a surface
or floor (but not every frame).</dd>
<dt><tt>add</tt></dt>
<dd>In this mode, all objects with this trigger number must be
activated before the trigger is fired. For example, if three objects
each have a <tt>trigger</tt> of <tt>4</tt> and a <tt>trigtype</tt> of
<tt>add</tt>, then trigger #4 is set off when all three objects are
destroyed.
<dt><tt>whenshot</tt></dt>
<dd>An additional modifier keyword; this means that (currently only
for walls) the trigger is set off when it is shot, instead of just
when it is touched. i.e. a wall with a <tt>trigtype</tt> of <tt>once
whenshot</tt> would set off a trigger one and only one time when
touched <i>or shot</i>. </dd>
<dt><tt>sound1, sound2</tt></dt>
<dd>Additional modifier keywords that indicate a sound is to be played
when this trigger is set off. <tt>sound1</tt> plays the switch beep sound,
<tt>sound2</tt> plays a siren sound.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Also know that the special trigger number -1 exists. Triggering -1 will result in successful level completion. Your level's goal should be a surface or wall that triggers -1, or an enemy that triggers -1 when killed.</p>

<a name="s14"><h2>14. Trigger responses</h2>
<p>Most objects can set off triggers, but several can respond to
triggers as well. Doors can be programmed to open, unlock, or jam
(open and permanently stay open), and objects can be programmed to
wake up or die when a certain trigger is activated. The <tt>-when</tt>
attributes specify the trigger numbers that cause these events.</p>

<h4>For doors:</h4>
<dl>
<dt><tt>openwhen</tt></dt>
<dd>The trigger number that will cause this door to open, whether it
is locked or not.</dd>
<dt><tt>unlockwhen</tt></dt>
<dd>The trigger number that will cause this door to unlock.</dd>
<dt><tt>jamwhen</tt></dt>
<dd>The trigger number that will cause this door to open and stay open
permanently.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>For objects:</h4>
<dl>
<dt><tt>wakewhen</tt></dt>
<dd>The trigger number that will cause this object's AI to become
alert or start attacking. Not implemented, yet.</dd>
<dt><tt>killwhen</tt></dt>
<dd>The trigger number that will cause this object to die.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>For masks:</h4>
<dl>
<dt><tt>openwhen</tt></dt>
<dd>The trigger number that will cause this mask to reveal (or conceal) itself.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="s15"><h2>15. Paths (<tt>paths</tt> layer)</h2>
<p>If you plan on utilizing [relatively] complex enemy AI in your level, you need to lay out a network of paths so that AI entities can navigate their way around corners and obstacles. Setting up such a network is simple; as with objects, place small rectangles (<tt>rect</tt> objects) in the <tt>paths</tt> layer, at corners and other strategic places in your level. To view the network of paths, set the option <tt>paths 1</tt> in the preferences file, or turn paths on from the configuration menu in-game.</p>

<p>The fewer nodes you use, the better. Arrange your nodes such that enemies can work their way around all obstacles. Preview the network in-game frequently and try to eliminate superfluous nodes.</p>
