1. Overview
-----------
svg2vl is a tool used for creating levels for Shotgun Debugger. It allows you
to design your levels in Inkscape (a free, open-source vector graphics editor
available at www.inkscape.org), then convert them from SVG format to the 
flat-file vl format understood by Shotgun Debugger.

Inkscape works with the SVG format, an XML language. It provides a handy XML
editor, which is used extensively for adding properties to the level (such
as object types, triggers, wall heights, etc.) that cannot be adequately
conveyed by the geometry. Also, the hierarchical structure allows objects
to inherit properties and transformations--a real timesaver.

svg2vl is a Perl script and requires several modules to function. It has only
been tested with Inkscape 0.40. Newer versions may break the script; however,
since I'm lazy, the chances that I'll update this are slim.


2. Installation
---------------
If you're on a *nix system, you've already got Perl. You may, however, need
to install the SVG-related modules from CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network, as follows.

Run the following commands as root (# indicates the command prompt)

# perl -MCPAN -e shell
...messages...
cpan> install SVG
...SVG installs...
cpan> install SVG::Parser
...SVG:Parser installs...

That should install the modules needed by svg2vl. 


If you're on Windows, you're going to need to install a Perl distribution.
ActivePerl from www.activestate.com works well. Instead of accessing CPAN
from perl, you use ppm.

Once ppm has started, run the following commands as above:
install SVG
install SVG::Parser

If you're on Windows, feel free to rename svg2vl to svg2vl.pl. It'll get
a nice icon.

For more help on installing the Perl modules, see the related documentation.


3. Use
------
For *nix, invoke svg2vl on the command line by typing
./svg2vl svg_file

(where svg_file is the name of the Inkscape SVG you'd like to convert.
The .svg extension is optional.)

On Windows, try dragging your SVG file's icon onto the svg2vl.pl icon
in Explorer. Or, assuming you have Perl set up properly, you can just
type
svg2vl.pl svg_file

The script runs, and produces a .vl file in the same directory as the SVG.
This file can then be played in Shotgun Debugger.

For more information on the VL format and designing levels, see the
leveldesign.html file that accompaines this document.


4. Other
--------
The file "level1.svg" that comes with this package has large amounts of
unnecessary geometry. The compiled file (level1.vl) that comes with
Shotgun Debugger 1.1 has been stripped of this unnecessary geometry, but
the smaller SVG file used to generate it has been lost. :(
