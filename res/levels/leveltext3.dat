The suits jacked my wrist computer and all my personal
electronics when I came in, so I still have no idea where I
am. Markings on the wall said "Sublevel 6," so I'm pretty
sure I'm underground, but exactly where underground is
a damn mystery to me.

I was poking around this facility's network from a
maintenance terminal, and it looks like Sublevel 5 is some
sort of holding area for outdated robots.

If these bots are obsolete, then I can't wait to see the
new models...
