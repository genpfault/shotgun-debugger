`All of us are very glad to have you here, and we feel you
`will be of great value to us. Didn't you find it a bit
`weird that you wound up in a strange complex after trying
`to crack that password? Little did you know it, but you
`took the bait just like we expected.

`When you were younger, you were part of our earlier
`experiments in human cybernetics and nano-enhancement.
`The times changed, and our focus shifted to purely
`autonomous systems. You were discharged, and your memories
`replaced with false ones of a normal teenage life.

No....this seriously isn't happening. My childhood...a
test subject...false memories...

`Now that our project is complete, we are ready to unleash

`without a leader though--that is why we have brought you

NEVER! You've gotta be joking. I'm here to SAVE everyone
from your damned new order. You'll have one hell of a time
trying to get me to surrender.

`The cybernetic systems we implanted in you are still

`Let's not waste any time now. Before you assume the
`position as commander, you must enter the central

`We expect you there promptly.

"Interface with the main processing unit." Blowing the
goddamn main processing unit into orbit sounds like a
better idea to me! Forget this prick. The map shows three
auxiliary processing cores on that level--we've gotta hit
the overrides on each of them before we can get into the
main CPU and hit the Big Red Switch. Let's do this.
